## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`. This file must include your code and write up for each task. Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline. Commit and push the Rmd and the md outputs of that file.

2.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people. You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly). You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TA for this course. You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

3.  You have until **[DUE DATE]** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will **not** be accepted. Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

4.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach. You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these. I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers. See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code.

5.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well. For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

1.  You may only use `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use any other R packages.

## Academic Integrity Statement

*I, Richie Rines, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone other than the Professor or TA during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

You are not allowed to post any questions on the public community repo or the public questions channel on Slack. Any questions about the exam must be asked in person in office hours or on Slack via direct message to the Professor or the TAs. For quickest response we recommend that you start a direct message with the Professor and all the TAs so that whoever gets to it first can respond to you.

## Grading and feedback

The total points for the questions add up to 90 points. The remaining 10 points are allocated to code style, commit frequency and messages, overall organization, spelling, grammar, etc. There is also an extra credit question that is worth 5 points. You will receive feedback as an issue posted to your repository, and your grade will also be recorded on Sakai.

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`. Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question. Add code chunks as needed. Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise.

Before completing, make sure to supress the code and look over your answers one more time. If the narrative seems sparse or choppy, edit as needed. Then, revert back to revealing your code.

Don't forget that you will need to configure your user name and email for Git to be able to push to your repository.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data. You will first need to install these packages and then load them.

```{r include = FALSE}
#| label: load_packages

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013. The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (10 points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013? Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.

***We use the flights data frame to solve this. First we use the `count` function to list all the flight destinations and then we sort them by descending order using `arrange`. Finally, we `slice` the data to only show the first entry through the tenth.***

```{r}
#| label: top10dest

nycflights13::flights %>%
  count(dest) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

***ORD, ATL, LAX, BOS, MCO, CLT, SFO, FLL, MIA, DCA***

2.  **Question 2 (10 points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013? Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline. In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well. *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.

***We combine the flights data frame and the airlines data frame using `inner_join` and join them by "carrier". We then use `count` to display the frequency of all the airline names and, using the `arrange` function, sort them in descending order.***

```{r}
#| label: top_airlines

nycflights13::flights %>%
  inner_join(nycflights13::airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  count(name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

***The top three airlines are United Air Lines Inc. (58665), JetBlue Airways (54635), and ExpressJet Airlines Inc (54173).***

3.  **Question 3 (10 points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information. Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

***We start by pipelining the `flights` data frame. We then `filter` the data to exclude any N/A values in the `arr_delay` variable. Then `group` them by "carrier" and `summarise` the mean of `arr_delay`. Arrange by descending mean values and `inner_join` it with `airline` by "carrier".***

```{r}
#| label: carrier_delay

nycflights13::flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>%
  inner_join(nycflights13::airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  print()
```

Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?
***Frontier Arlines Inc. (F9) had the highest mean with 21.9***

Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?
***Alaska Airlines Inc. (AS) has the lowest mean with -9.9 ***

4.  **Question 4 (10 points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay? Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.

***First we create a new dataset called `high_delay` to find the highest delay. We create a variable called `date` (which is exactly that) using `mutate` and `str_c` to connect the strings. Then we arrange the list by descending departure delays and keep only the top one. Next, we use the weather data frame. We make another `date` variable just like before. Then we can filter the data frame by the date of the highest delay and the `origin` of the highest delay. Finally, we `select` and `summarise` the origin, temp, and date.***

```{r}
#| label: temp_high_delay

high_delay <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(date = str_c(month, "/", day, "/", year)) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%
  slice(1)

nycflights13::weather %>%
  mutate(date = str_c(month, "/", day, "/", year)) %>%
  filter(date == high_delay$date,
         origin == high_delay$origin) %>%
  select(origin, temp, date) %>%
  summarise(origin = origin[1], date = date[1], temp = mean(temp))
```

***A flight out of JFK on 1/9/2013 had the highest departure delay. The mean temperature for that day was 42.7 degrees.***

5.  **Question 5 (15 points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.

***First we create a new set called `flight_time` and base it off of `flights`. Then we `mutate` a variable called `time_intv` and make different time intervals. If the numbers look a but confusing (such as `6:11` and `12:17`) it's because they use military time.***

```{r}
#| label: time_intervals

flight_time <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(time_intv = case_when(hour %in% 0:5 ~ "12:01am-6:00am",
                               hour %in% 6:11 ~ "6:01am-12:00pm",
                               hour %in% 12:17 ~ "12:01pm-6:00pm",
                               hour %in% 18:24 ~ "6:01pm-12:00am"))
```

    a\. Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.
```{r}
flight_time %>%
  group_by(time_intv) %>%
  reframe(., delay_proportion = group_size(filter(., dep_delay > 0))/group_size(.)) %>%
  slice(1, 6, 11, 16) #sliced to eliminate repeats
```
***From 12am to 12pm, the proportion is just about 25%. Then from 12pm to 6pm, it's about 44%. Finally, from 6pm to 12am, it goes up to 50%.***

    b\. Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?
***The chances of a flight getting delayed increase as the day progresses.***

6.  **Question 6 (15 points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.

***This question is a bit lighter when it comes to the code. We start by making a data frame called `long_flight` using the `flights` data. Then we use `slice_max` to take the top `air_time` and join the data frame with the `planes` data by "tailnum". We join the data frames so we can see what plane the particular flight used and how many seats it had.***

```{r}
#| label: long_time

long_flight <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  slice_max(air_time) %>%
  inner_join(nycflights13::planes, "tailnum")
```

    a\. How long is this flight?
  ***It was `r long_flight$air_time` minutes long***
    
    b\. What city did it fly to?
  ***It flew to `r long_flight$dest` (Honolulu, Hawaii)***

    c\. How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?
  ***It has `r long_flight$seats` seats***

7.  **Question 7 (15 pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports. These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates. In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States). Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States. What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports? *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well. Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.

***I used the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) to find the `long` and `lat` values of the contiguous US. I then filtered the `airports` data frame to stay within those limits. Then I used `ggplot` to make a graph and labeled it with `labs`.***

```{r}
#| label: distb_long

nycflights13::airports %>%
  filter(lat < 49.00239,
         lat > 24.44667,
         lon < -66.9498,
         lon > -124.785) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of the longitudes of airports", subtitle = "in the United States", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")
```

***The graph shows that the distribution of airports is actually really even across the whole country. However there is an abundance of airports along the east coast a slightly-more-than-average amount dotted along the west coast.***

8.  **Question 8 (15 pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data. Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be. *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame. You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.

![](img/plot-to-recreate.png)

```{r}
#| label: performance_plot

nycflights13::flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("PHL", "RDU"),
         !is.na(arr_delay),
         month == 12) %>%
  mutate(arrival = if_else(arr_delay > 0, "delayed", "ontime")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival, y = dep_delay, color = dest)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(dest ~ origin) +
  labs(x = "Arrival", y = "Departure delay", color = "Destination", 
       title = "On time performance of NYC flights", subtitle = "December 2013")
```

***The plot compares flight departure delays in December 2013 in and out of different airports. It also shows if the flight arrived on time or if it happened to be late.***

**Extra Credit (5 pts)** - Create a visualization that effectively shows if there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay and the average daily temperature for all three New York city airports. Your answer must be given in a single pipe. (You should only spend time on this question once you have finished answering the others)
